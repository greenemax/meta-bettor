# MetaBettor: Make Better Bets

MetaBettor is a logging journal designed for all sports gamblers. Log in, log bets, log out. A simple function that allows modern gamblers a central location to track each of their bets. Log your initial bet when you place it, then update your bets as results are determined.

## Planning Story

I visited my buddy Dan who lives in Las Vegas last year. Dan is a successful sports bettor who frequents many different casinos, but I noticed he lacked a digital resource to log his different bets. Bets were not all placed at the same location, and they varyied in structure and amount of money invested. I knew there had to be a better way to bet - and that inspired MetaBettor, a digital betting journal where a gambler can log in. Sports bettors, casual to advanced, have a new tool to stay more aware of their bet. Track historical performance and wins and losses.

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to make the update functionality a bit more savy, improve style to be a little more professional, and increase capacity on the api. There's a ton of ideas that I left on the sidelines for this project but would like to integrate in future versions. First, I want to make the update form a part of the generated bet content, not a simple form on top. It's way too tedious to update a bet right now. Then, I'd like to improve the bet description to more intuititively capture that info in a more helpful way. Right now too much onus is on the user to remember and re-enter the information.
- Would like to eventually get odds and bet data in an api so that users wouldn't have to recall their bets from memory. I'd like to also create a user reporting section so that if you were a longtime user you could leverage your own data to become a more strategic and educated sports bettor. Wins and Losses should display a bit more obviously.

## Planning Story

I visited my buddy Dan who lives in Las Vegas last year. Dan is a successful sports bettor who frequents many different casinos, but I noticed he lacked a digital resource to log his different bets. Bets were not all placed at the same location, and they varyied in structure and amount of money invested. I knew there had to be a better way to bet - and that inspired MetaBettor, a digital betting journal where a gambler can log in. Sports bettors, casual to advanced, have a new tool to stay more aware of their bet. Track historical performance and wins and losses.
